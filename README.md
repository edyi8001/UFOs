# UFOs
## Project Overview
The objective of this anaylsis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by using JavaScript for our client Dana. The client wanted users to have the ability to filter by multiple criteria, using date, city, state, country and shape.
## Results

On the left of the website, users will have the ability to filter by one or multiple filters of the search criteria. Utilizing multiple criteria date, city, state, country and shape allows users to get particular results wanted.
## Drawbacks
- The search field is case-sensitive, so in return filtering out certain criterias can be a little tedious
## Recommendations 
- A drop down option instead of typing out filters would be quicker and allow users to see what is filter criteria is available
- For bigger analysis for grouping of dates, maybe add another date filter creating a range criteria. This way users can see multiple results within multiple dates.
